# Ekso

Ekso is a little utility to `require` entire directory structures, modify the
naming and initilization, and spit out a `Object` for further usage. It supports
CoffeeScript out of the box.

It was developed exclusively while riding buses in Europe. Dude needs something
better to do than watching those stupid shows, right?

## Test === Docs

Ekso has full test coverage which also acts as documentation
(because I am a lazy brah). Run them via:

    npm test
